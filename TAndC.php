    INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    WATTBA is an online mobile platform designed specifically to connect Vendor
    salons, merchants, stylists and Vendors (hereon referred to as “Vendors”)
    providing hair and beauty services (the "Services") with clients seeking
    such services ("Clients").
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    THE SERVICE
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    This Mobile App has been made available solely for Vendors and Clients to
    connect and serves only as a medium to facilitate the provision of hair and
    beauty service. We do not provide or contract for Service, and Vendors and
    Clients contract independently for the provision of Service. The selection
    of a Vendor is solely at the discretion of the Client, the Service to be
    provided and the location at which Service will be performed, whether on
    the premises of a Vendor or at a site designated by the Client. Any
    decision by a Client to receive Service or by a Vendor to provide Service
    is a decision made in such person's sole discretion and at their own risk.
    Users understand and acknowledge that (i) We do not conduct background
    checks on Clients and (ii) any provision of Services in a private location
    inherently increases the risks involved for both Clients, Vendors and any
    personnel of Vendors, as applicable. Each Vendor must decide whether a
    Client is suited to such Vendor's services and should exercise caution and
    common sense to protect the personal safety and property of such Vendor and
    its personnel, as applicable, just as they would when interacting with
    anyone they don’t know. NEITHER COMPANY, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS,
    CONTRACTORS OR LICENSORS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR
    OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES AND YOU HEREBY AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND
    HOLD HARMLESS THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS FROM ANY
    LIABILITY RELATED THERETO. COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL
    NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH
    YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.

    take reasonable efforts to ensure secure transmission of your information
    to third parties who assess and process payments We will not be liable for
    any fees or charges placed by third parties or any errors in the processing
    of payments, including errors arising out of such third party’s negligence,
    improper transmission of payment details or an error on the end of a
    Client.
